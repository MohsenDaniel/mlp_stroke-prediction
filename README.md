# Machine Learning Project - Stroke Prediction
## Introduction

This project is a Machine Learning project that aims to use the dataset from the 'stroke.csv' file to train a Machine Learning model that predicts whether a person has had a stroke or not based on other variables, such as physical attributes (such as age, average glucose level, etc.), life choices (such as work type, smoking status, etc.), and health conditions (such as hypertension and heart disease).

→ Problem type: Therefore the Machine Learning problem that will be tackled in this project is a binary classification problem, since we will want to classify every person as either having had a stroke or not.

→ Target variable: In other words, our target variable, i.e. the variable that we are trying to predict, for this project will be the 'stroke' status, represented in the dataset as a boolean.

→ Feature variables: As already hinted at, the feature variables for this project will be the remaining columns in the dataset, which will be carefully analysed in the course of this project, and are:

- Gender
- Work type
- Residence type
- Smoking status
- "Ever married" status
- Hypertension status
- Heart disease status
- Age
- Average glucose level
- Body mass index
